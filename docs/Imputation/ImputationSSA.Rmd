## Intro

Trait based analysis of species are used at varying levels of organisational and complexity to address fundamental ecological and evolutionary questions [@Lavorel2002;@Graham2012]. These life history traits generally include physiological, physical and evolutionary parameters that aim to describe species quantitatively. However, many of these traits are often missing from databases because the majority of species are cryptic, rare or too hard too access for detailed study (Nakagawa and Freckleton, 2008). Subsequently, many of these trait databases which take inordinate amounts of collaborative effort and resources to generate and maintain often suffer from the plague of missing data,  and more importantly, the loss of statistical power that accompanies large datasets with missing values (Penone et al., 2014). 

Parasites exceptionally cryptic nature that often encompasses multiple and complex life stages, and their unique feeding strategies means that they are particularly vulnerable to missing trait data (Marcogliese, 2004). Consequently, there remains relatively few ecological databases that incorporate parasite trait data, and even fewer that span the breadth of whole ecosystems (Gibson, 2005; Nunn and Altizer, 2005; Strona et al., 2013). Because parasites already pose challenges to traditional network ecology theory and remain relatively understudied compared to charismatic large bodied organisms, finding datasets that contain both parasite trait data and the ecological interactions that accompany this is difficult and only a few examples currently exist, and even these suffer from missing trait values (Baird and Milne, 1981; Hechinger et al., 2011).

A complete ecological network containing both feeding interactions and biomass, abundance and body size data would allow me to analyse the impact that parasites have on energy flow throughout food webs. Traditionally network ecology focuses on structural or topological patterns of networks looking at key metrics and statistics, which parasites are known to increase the complexity of, resulting in a more interconnected and complex web when compared to non-parasitic webs (Dunne et al., 2013). Topological analysis of food webs including parasite interactions has developed rapidly, with new models able to account for their unusual inverse consumer-resource ratios and these are likely to develop rapidly in the future increasing both our understanding and accuracy of these food web interactions (Warren et al., 2010). Topological analyses alone is unlikely to reveal the true impact that parasites have upon food webs, particularly regarding ecosystem energetics, where it is suggested they account for considerable amounts of energy flux between trophic levels, a previously neglected observation (Preston et al., 2013). Lack of empirical food web data, and accompanying biomass and body-size observations means that estimations of parasites impact on energy flux throughout a web is limited. 

The most complete dataset containing both ecological interactions and allometric datapoints for taxa including parasites is that of Hechingerâ€™s 2011 study of the Carpinteria salt marsh. This large salt marsh was separated into three sub-areas and each sampled individually to determine the feeding interactions between parasites and other taxa present, yielding an ecological network that could reveal how parasites influence the structure and dynamics of ecosystems (Lafferty et al., 2008; Hechinger et al., 2011). Along the way many species trait values like body size and life stage values were recording, in addition to ecological parameters like total biomass and species abundance. However, as stated above the nature of parasites makes them hard to observe, resulting in patchy recorded values for many life history traits.

One way to overcome missing life history and trait data involves imputation, a mathematical and statistical process where missing data points are replaced with substituted values. These imputation approaches are numerous, often involving complex single, multiple or likelihood-based approaches, but the most appropriate imputation technique depends on the type of missing data you have, and the other variables present in the data set (Figure 1.)
